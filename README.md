# Assignment-2

This project contains custom implementations of two list types in Java without using built-in collections.

- Add elements (to end, beginning, or by index)
- Remove elements (by index, first, or last)
- Get and set elements
- Search (`indexOf`, `lastIndexOf`, `exists`)
- Convert list to array
- Clear the list
- Iterable support (for-each loop)
